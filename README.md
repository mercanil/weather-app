## Database Selection TimescaleDB

#### Time-Series Data Optimization

TimescaleDB is built on top of PostgreSQL and is optimized for time-series data. This is particularly beneficial for our
application, which deals extensively with sensor data, inherently time-series in nature.

#### Rich Query Capabilities

By inheriting PostgreSQL's features, TimescaleDB allows us to use complex SQL queries, which is crucial for our data
analysis and reporting needs.

#### Compatibility with PostgreSQL

Since TimescaleDB is an extension of PostgreSQL, it allows us to use the vast array of PostgreSQL tools and features,
while also benefiting from TimescaleDB's time-series functionalities.

## Missing Parts

TimescaleDB configuration requires more time and unfortunetly I couldn't complete this part

Data validation is not as good as it should be but tried to cover important parts

Logging is not on a good state.

## Technologies Used

### Spring-Boot
The Spring framework is dominating the java world for quite some time and itâ€™s a very well-established framework Spring has the most significant community out of all frameworks and integrations with almost every third-party system.

Spring-Boot provides a simple way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It is designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications. Spring Boot also makes it easy to create production-ready applications by providing features such as embedded servers, configuration management, health checks, and security.

#### Why Spring-boot
* Documentation & Community support
* Wide range of features and plugins
* Developer experience
* Production-readiness: Provides features like health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration that make it easy to create production-ready applications.

### Spring Data JPA
Simplifying the database access layer by reducing the boilerplate code.


### Test Containers

Easy testing with container images

### OpenAPI (Swagger)
Enabling seamless API documentation for better understanding and testing.
