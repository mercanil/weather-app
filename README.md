## Deployment (*WIP)
The customer-service project can be deployed using terraform files under `deployment/terraform`. The work is still in progress and only contains deployment files for API service and does not contain dependent services.

## Technologies Used

### Spring-Boot
The Spring framework is dominating the java world for quite some time and itâ€™s a very well-established framework Spring has the most significant community out of all frameworks and integrations with almost every third-party system.

Spring-Boot provides a simple way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It is designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications. Spring Boot also makes it easy to create production-ready applications by providing features such as embedded servers, configuration management, health checks, and security.

#### Why Spring-boot
* Documentation & Community support
* Wide range of features and plugins
* Developer experience
* Production-readiness: Provides features like health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration that make it easy to create production-ready applications.

### Spring Data JPA
Simplifying the database access layer by reducing the boilerplate code.

### Why SQL
* Data integrity. SQL databases deliver a high degree of data integrity, adhering to the principles of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID)
* Schema of the database is well defined

### Redis
Supporting primary database as cache layer.
Redis stores data in the server's main memory rather than on hard disks and solid-state drives. This leads to significantly faster response times when performing read and write operations.

### Test Containers
Redis stores data in the server's main memory rather than on hard disks and solid-state drives. This leads to significantly faster response times when performing read and write operations.

### OpenAPI (Swagger)
Enabling seamless API documentation for better understanding and testing.
