## Technologies Used

### Spring-Boot
The Spring framework is dominating the java world for quite some time and itâ€™s a very well-established framework Spring has the most significant community out of all frameworks and integrations with almost every third-party system.

Spring-Boot provides a simple way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It is designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications. Spring Boot also makes it easy to create production-ready applications by providing features such as embedded servers, configuration management, health checks, and security.

#### Why Spring-boot
* Documentation & Community support
* Wide range of features and plugins
* Developer experience
* Production-readiness: Provides features like health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration that make it easy to create production-ready applications.

### Spring Data JPA
Simplifying the database access layer by reducing the boilerplate code.


### Test Containers

Easy testing with real container images

### OpenAPI (Swagger)
Enabling seamless API documentation for better understanding and testing.
